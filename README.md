# The cheapest fork you've ever seen to make this plugin work on Minecraft 1.19.3
## Tested on paper 1.19.3 

Last version broke the custom NBT items table, so i fixed it (see commit) so I could use it on my funni server.
Basically just updated dependencies and added a few lines of code for the NBTAPI to work.
AFAIK last maintainer is done updating this plugin because he archived his repo.
I'd take it up to continue because I like HG, but this plugin has way too many dependencies, old APIs, bugs, and it's written in java (lol) 

Feel free to fork or make a pull request if you wanna add some cheap fix like I did haha.
